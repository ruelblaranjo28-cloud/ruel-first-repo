# ruel-first-repo

My first GitHub repository for learning and practicing version control
This is my first GitHub repository. I created this to learn the basics of Git and GitHub, including:
- Creating repositories
- Edit files
- Committing changes
- Understanding version control
I will use this repository to practice and improve my skills as I work toward becoming a Data Scientist.

## What I’m Learning
- Git Basics
- GitHub workflow
- How to manage projects
- How to upload and organize files

## About Me
I am Ruel Laranjo, a Computer Science Engineering graduate, starting my journey in Data Science and building my portfolio step-by-step.

More projects coming soon!
